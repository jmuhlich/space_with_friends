"Proto" classes appear to represent persistable state to be stored in ConfigNodes for saving.

ProtoCrewMember
 - No non-proto equivalent. What is the class representing "live" crew members?

ProtoVessel.Load(FlightState st)
 - Should probably pass HighLogic.CurrentGame.flightState.
 - Can also take a second Vessel arg, but if null a new Vessel will automatically be created.

Game.AddVessel(ConfigNode protoVesselNode)
 - Looks like the right high-level function to simply "deserialize" a vessel into the game.
 - Calls ProtoVessel.Load
 - Getting the right ConfigNode here seems tricky.

ProtoCrewMember.ChangeName(string newName)
 - Allows updating name, which I think Andy was having problems with?
